About
-----
TinySound is a simple sound system that wraps the standard Java sound libraries.
It is "tiny" in that it is intended to have a small, easy-to-use interface with
everything that you need in a simple sound system and nothing that you don't.

Using TinySound
---------------
There are 3 classes that you need to know when using TinySound: TinySound, Music
and Sound.  TinySound is the main system class, Music is an abstraction for
music, and Sound is an abstraction for a sound effect.  Simple.

-TinySound-
There are really only 2 steps you need to worry about with the TinySound class.
1. Initialization
2. Shutdown

1. Initialization is accomplished via one of the two init() functions:
-The first one (and probably the only one you will care about) takes no
arguments and sets up the system for you to automatically write any sound data
to the speakers 40 times per second.  TinySound creates another thread to
perform updates.  This should be sufficient in almost all use cases.
-The second one allows you to specify at what rate you would like sound data to
be written to the speakers and whether or not TinySound should write the data
automatically or if you would like to handle those updates yourself.
Note:  If you choose to not have TinySound automatically update, you must call
one of the update() methods yourself at the rate specified.  See the Javadocs
for more detail.

2. Shutdown is accomplished via the shutdown() function.  It is especially
important that you shutdown TinySound if the system has been initialized to
perform automatic updates so it can stop the update thread.

-Music-
You load Music objects via the TinySound loadMusic() functions.  Music objects
can be started, stopped, paused, resumed, and looped from specified positions.
If you are done using a particular Music object, you can also unload its sound
data from the system via its unload() function.  See the Javadocs for more
detail.

-Sound-
You load Sound objects via the TinySound loadSound() functions.  Sound objects
work differently from Music objects as you can only play them (no pausing etc.).
When a Sound is played it is queued to be played from the speakers once.  Of
course, you can play a Sound multiple times in an overlapping fashion so it is
generally useful for sound effects.
